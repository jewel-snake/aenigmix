Aenigmix is a simple encription library that utilizes Kolakoski sequence properties to generate bitmask from key for XORing byte sequence of any length.
Thus, without knowledge of the initial key it is impossible to guess the bitmask as it always changes and never repeats.
However, this algorithm is using as much space as the subject of encription does, so applying it to the big files leads into double space usage of mentioned file size.
